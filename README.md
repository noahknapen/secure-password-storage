According to [https://ciit.finki.ukim.mk/data/papers/10CiiT/10CiiT-46.pdf](Modes Of Operation Of The AES Algorithm), the best mode of operation is considered to be AES-CTR. Since the password manager will not be used often, performance is a lesser factor and thus allows for a larger key size of 256 bits.
